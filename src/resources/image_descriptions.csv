Due to the limitations of herbarium images and the lack of specific identifiers, I can only describe the general characteristics of the plant as observed:

- **Leaves**
  - Shape: simple, lobed, compound, other. (This is too vague for herbarium specimens without a clear view or taxonomic context.)
  - Margin: entire, toothed, scalloped. (Too vague to determine accurately.)
  - Arrangement: opposite, alternate, whorled. (The view of the plant in the image does not allow for an accurate assessment of leaf arrangement.)
  - Texture: smooth, rough, velvety. (Without a clear view or high-resolution details, it is difficult to determine the texture of the leaves with certainty.)

- **Stem**
  - Type: woody, herbaceous, hollow, solid. (The image does not provide enough information to confidently identify the type of stem.)
  - Cross-section: round, square, angular. (Determining the cross-section of a stem from a herbarium image would require additional context or a clearer view of the plant's structure.)
  - Presence of hairs or spines: yes, no. (There are no visible hairs or spines in this particular image.)

Please note that for an accurate analysis, a more detailed and focused view of the plant's features would be necessary. The limitations of herbarium images and the lack of specific identifiers make it difficult to provide precise observations based on the options given. "

'The surface of the leaf has a slightly rough texture, which could be indicative of a specific type of leaf cell structure. The plant material appears to have a thick cuticle, which is common in many plant species for protection against water loss and environmental stresses. There are no visible hairs or spines.
